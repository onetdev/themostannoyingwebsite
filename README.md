# The most annoying website 

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e13ea0d0-b77d-4307-a5a4-2e413461e3ad/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/themostannoyingwebsite/deploys)

The main idea is to collect all the disgusting features from today's website in one place.

At the moment we are (plan to) supporting the following features:
- [x] Chat bubble with incoming messages and notification sound
- [x] "Read more" at the bottom of the article.
- [x] Marquee
- [x] Wheel of fortune coupon modal
- [x] Add confirmation when trying to leave the page
- [ ] Age verification on some images
- [ ] Endless toggles for GDPR settings
- [ ] Randomly appearing newsletter subscription modal
- [ ] Asking for notification (no worries, the website won't send any notification)
- [ ] Asking for location permission (no worries, the website won't use your location)
- [ ] Sticky video player obscuring the page visibility. (+audio)
- [ ] Randomly loading images while scrolling.
- [ ] Low Quality images
- [ ] Funny, silly contents (like Onion news)
- [ ] Design

In order to avoid adblockers this repo uses "gift" instead of anything that would resemble ad-like content (eg.: promotion, advertisement).
